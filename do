# Tableau Cloud Administration – Setup Guide

## Objective
Set up a secure Tableau Cloud environment using Zero Trust principles
and role-based access control (RBAC).

---

## Step 1: Create Tableau Cloud Site
- Signed up for Tableau Cloud trial
- Created a new site in the US-East region
- Verified site access and admin privileges

---

## Step 2: Configure Authentication (Zero Trust)
- Enabled **Tableau with MFA** as the default authentication method
- Ensured all users authenticate using MFA
- Prevented anonymous or password-only access

---

## Step 3: User Management
- Added users to the site using email-based identity
- Assigned minimum required **site roles** (Explorer / Viewer)
- Followed least-privilege access model

---

## Step 4: RBAC Implementation
- Controlled access using Tableau site roles
- Ensured users only had access required for publishing or viewing
- Verified role enforcement by login testing

---

## Step 5: Site Governance
- Reviewed site settings for security controls
- Verified site status and licensing limits
- Ensured administrative access is restricted

---

## Outcome
A secure Tableau Cloud environment was successfully deployed with:
- MFA-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Admin-governed site configuration
